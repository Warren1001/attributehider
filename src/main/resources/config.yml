# NOTE: The two links below are the most up to date lists used for this configuration. If you are on an older version of the game,
#       the enums given in each list may not exist or have a different name. You are on your own for figuring out the proper name
#       on older game versions.
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html - This is the list of all item flags, CASE_SENSITIVE.
# The key of a list needs to be the exact match of an ItemFlag enum listed in the link above.
#
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html - This is the list of all available materials, CASE_SENSITIVE.
# You can change the value of each list to true or false, one Material, or a list of Materials.
# True means it will remove the modifier from all items. False means it will not remove the modifier from any item.
# Explicitly putting a material/some materials will whitelist only those materials to be modified.
# Here's an example of possible values:
# lists:
#   HIDE_ATTRIBUTES: DIAMOND_SWORD # Hides attributes for a diamond sword only.
# -- or --
# lists:
#   HIDE_ENCHANTS: # Hides enchants for a diamond sword and a diamond axe only.
#   - DIAMOND_SWORD
#   - DIAMOND_AXE
# -- or --
# lists:
#   HIDE_ADDITIONAL_TOOLTIP: false # Will NOT hide any additional tooltips for any item.
# -- or --
# lists:
#   HIDE_UNBREAKABLE: true # Hides the unbreakable tag on all items.
#
# The values given in each list are only used if the name of the ItemFlag is spelled correctly including case sensitivity.
# It will otherwise be ignored. If you find that something is not working and there are no errors, make sure you have the
# correct ItemFlag spelling.

  HIDE_ADDITIONAL_TOOLTIP: false
